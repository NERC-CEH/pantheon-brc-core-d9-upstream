INTRODUCTION
------------

Language Switcher Dropdown is a very simple module that exposes a new block,
similar to the default Language Switcher block provided by the Locale module.

The new block allows site visitors to switch languages using a drop-down select
list instead of using hyperlinks.

The module also integrates well with the Language Icons module if installed.
